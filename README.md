# Human Resources Data Analysis Project

## Project Overview

This project involves a comprehensive analysis of a Human Resources dataset, utilizing SQL for data processing and Power BI for visualization. The aim is to uncover key insights about the workforce of an organization, spanning demographics, employment trends, and departmental structures.

## Dataset Overview

The analysis is based on a detailed Human Resources dataset, providing an array of information about the organization's employees.

### Dataset Details

- **File Name**: `Human Resources.csv`
- **Number of Rows**: 22,214
- **Number of Columns**: 13

### Columns Description

The dataset includes columns for employee ID, name, birthdate, gender, race, department, job title, location, hire date, term date, and more. The dataset has been cleaned and preprocessed to ensure data quality and consistency.

## Data Cleaning and Preparation

Several steps were taken to clean and prepare the dataset:

1. Standardization of date formats for 'birthdate', 'hire_date', and 'termdate'.
2. Conversion of relevant columns to appropriate data types.
3. Calculation and addition of the 'age' column.
4. Implementation of various data integrity checks.

SQL was utilized for these data cleaning tasks, ensuring that the dataset was ready for detailed analysis.

## Project Analysis

The project answers several key questions about the workforce:

1. Gender and race/ethnicity breakdown.
2. Age distribution and trends.
3. Comparison of employees at headquarters vs. remote locations.
4. Analysis of average employment length, departmental turnover, job title distribution, and more.

These questions were addressed using sophisticated SQL queries, which allowed for a deep dive into the dataset.

## Data Visualization and Reporting

The insights derived from the analysis were visualized using Power BI, resulting in an interactive and user-friendly report. This report contains various visualizations, such as demographic breakdowns, age distributions, employment trends, and more, providing a comprehensive view of the workforce data.

## Accessing the Report

The Power BI report, "HR Employee Report", can be accessed through [link or instructions]. This interactive report offers a dynamic way to explore the data and uncover deeper insights.

## Conclusion

This project provides a multi-faceted view of the organization's workforce, revealing important trends and insights that can inform decision-making and strategy. Through careful data analysis and effective visualization, it offers a valuable resource for understanding the dynamics of the company's human resources.
